# RBF-fPINNs: Radial Basis Function-Enhanced Fractional Physics-Informed Neural Network
We introduce a groundbreaking RBF augmented fPINN framework, called RBFfPINN,
for effectively addressing fractional mobile-immobile problems. This innovative
framework integrates RBF neural networks with fundamental physical laws, showcasing
a modified approach to solving fractional PDEs.

All computational experiments are carried out in PyTorch, utilizing a single NVIDIA Tesla V100 graphics processing unit.
